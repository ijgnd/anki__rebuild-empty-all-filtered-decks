An Anki add-on that adds "Rebuild All" and "Empty All" buttons to the bottom of the main screen, to rebuild or empty all filtered decks at once.

The original for Anki 2.0 is <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1639597619" rel="nofollow">here</a>. khonkhortisan released it for 2.1 as <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1810938259" rel="nofollow">Rebuild All &amp; Empty All for Anki 2.1</a>. My release adds the option to set in the add-on config which decks are built first and last: This might be useful if a card matches the criteria of multiple of your filtered decks because cards can only be in one filtered deck.
